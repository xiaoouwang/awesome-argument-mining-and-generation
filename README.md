# Awesome argument mining (AM) and argument/counter-argument generation

Ressources (articles, workshops, tutorials, videos, books etc.) in Argument Mining (AM) and Argument Generation (AG). Pull requests/contributions/co-managing are welcome.

# Counter-argument generation

* Bilu et al. (2015) composed opposing claims combining rules with classiÔ¨Åers.

* Hidey and McKeown (2019) tackled an analog task with neural methods.
